Dear Diary! On September 16th the autumn semester 2019 started. Lectures, super-cheap canteen food and exercises etc. are waiting for me. I especially like the ECL I lecture and I can hardly wait to learn more about automatic language processing. I am looking forward to the tutorials that will take place every Friday at 12:15 p.m. from the second week on. I am also very much looking forward to the "Kennen+Lern-Tage"...
Mr. O'Neill thinks that the boys' stories about Chile's capital aren't amusing.
